Children enjoy their meals and fondly remember all their favourite foods, from a holiday special family recipe or something they eat at festivals or even birthday parties!

So writing about it will make them feel good. When your child writes an essay on ‘My Favourite Food’ for classes 1, 2 or 3, they must first think and imagine several ideas that they can write about. This improves their thought process. Then they write those ideas in simple sentences. This activity lays their foundation in English grammar and improves their vocabulary and creative writing skills.

        My mother makes delicious biryani at home.
        Everyone in my family enjoys eating it every Sunday, it’s a staple!
        Biryani is best enjoyed along with some curd or raita.

    <p class="para">As children grow, they are expected to be able to write their ideas in simple sentences weaved into a paragraph. Let us help them write a small composition on their favourite food in about 150 words:

        My favourite food is a burger. It has many layers of fresh vegetables, sauces and a patty filled between two buns. A burger is a fun dish, and everyone at home enjoys eating it. Many restaurants serve delicious burgers, but I love the one my mother makes at home. I love the taste of the fresh, crunchy lettuce leaves, the tangy tomatoes and the cheese that melts in the mouth. Burgers are my favourite 4 pm snack, and my mom always makes it as healthy as she can! I love every bite! </p>
        <h1>MY FAVORITE FOOD IS PIZZA</h1>
    <p class="para">Food is an essential part of a child’s life. At a growing age, they need food to become healthy and fit. They also have their favourites from the wide range of foods they have tasted and enjoyed. Let us help your child compose a beautiful essay on their favourite food essay 200 words for class 3:

        I love eating delicious food, but of them all, pizza is my favourite. It originated in Italy many years ago. A pizza is made of a round flat base, spread with a special pizza sauce and lots of toppings like tomatoes, basil, onions, jalapenos, capsicum, mushroom or meat. To top it all, there is lots of cheese, which is my favourite part!
        
        My mother bakes delicious pizzas at home. On every special occasion, we all enjoy her homemade pizzas. She makes them from scratch, right from making the base. She puts lots of vegetables on top, mixed with mushrooms to make it healthier and more nutritious. I love each bite of the crispy crust with the vegetables and cheese. It is healthy and full of nutritious ingredients and also very yummy. I look forward to the days when we have pizza for dinner!</p>
